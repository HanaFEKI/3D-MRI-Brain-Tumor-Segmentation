    "- **Interactive Input**: Accepts a single `.npy` file with 3 channels (FLAIR, T1ce, T2), directly processed without additional preprocessing to match the pre-trained model’s expected input.\n",
    "- **Output**: Uses `gr.Plot` to display two Matplotlib figures: one for the input image (FLAIR) and one for the segmented result, with a `gr.Textbox` for the diagnosis message.\n",
    "- **Class Integration**: \n",
    "  - `DatasetHandler`: Retained for training reference but not used in inference (direct `.npy` loading as per original logic).\n",
    "  - `UNetModel`: Loads the pre-trained model from `'brats_3d.hdf5'` using `load_model(compile=False)`; includes `build_unet` as a reference implementation (see UNetModel Class).\n",
    "  - `SegmentationApp`: Manages the segmentation process and visualization for the `.npy` input, mirroring the original logic.\n",
    "- **Pre-trained Model**: Loads `'brats_3d.hdf5'` directly. If loading fails, an error message is returned, prompting the user to ensure the model file is present.\n",
    "- **Interactive Control**: Includes a \"Stop Processing\" button to allow users to interrupt the processing and avoid unnecessary computation.\n"
